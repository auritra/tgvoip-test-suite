wipe the grease off his dirty face
mend the coat before you go out
the wrist was badly strained and hung limp
the stray cat gave birth to kittens
the young girl gave no clear response
the meal was cooked before the bell rang
what joy there is in living
a king ruled the state in the early days
the ship was torn apart on the sharp reef
sickness kept him home the third week
the wide road shimmered in the hot sun
the lazy cow lay in the cool grass
lift the square stone over the fence
the rope will bind the seven books at once
hop over the fence and plunge in
the friendly gang left the drug store
mesh wire keeps chicks inside
the frosty air passed through the coat
the crooked maze failed to fool the mouse
adding fast leads to wrong sums
